# Contributing

We welcome and greaty appreciate contributions from the community! You can
help make the Uncertainty Toolbox even better by either

1. [Creating a PR](#create-a-pr) to fix a bug or add functionality.
2. [Report a bug](#report-a-bug) that you found in the toolbox.
3. [Request a feature](#request-a-feature) that you would like to
   see in the toolbox.

# Create a PR

To create a PR:

1. If applicable, make sure to write unit tests that exhaustively tests your
   added code. Run all unit tests and ensure that there are no failures.
2. Submit a PR to the dev branch. If your PR fixes a bug, detail what the
   problem was and how it was fixed. If your PR adds code, add justification
   for why this code should be added.
3. The maintainers will discuss your PR and merge it into the dev branch if
   accepted. The dev branch will be merged into the master branch for the
   next release.

### What kind of additional features are we looking for?

If there is an important metric that you believed that we missed, we would be
grateful if you submitted a PR adding this metric. For other types of features
ask yourself:

* Does this change add a new feature that will have a positive effect on the
  majority of the toolbox's users?
* Does this change make the codebase more confusing or difficult to deal with?
* Does this change make add heavy or niche dependencies?

Feel free to [submit an issues](#request-a-feature) before making the 
feature to see if your feature is something that the maintainers would want.
